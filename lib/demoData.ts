    question: 'What is the difference between working memory and long-term memory?',
    answer: 'Working memory is a temporary storage system that holds a limited amount of information (about 7Â±2 items) for a short duration, while long-term memory is a relatively permanent storage system with unlimited capacity.',

    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is metacognition?',
    answer: 'Metacognition is the awareness and understanding of one\'s own thought processes. It involves thinking about thinking, including knowledge about cognitive tasks and strategies to regulate cognitive activities.',

    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is the spacing effect?',
    answer: 'The spacing effect refers to the finding that information is better remembered when study sessions are spaced out over time rather than massed together (cramming). This is the principle behind spaced repetition systems.',

    id: 'demo-card-4',
    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve?',
    answer: 'The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve describes the exponential decline of memory retention over time. Most forgetting happens shortly after learning, and retention levels off over time, which is why spaced repetition is effective.',

  {
    id: 'demo-card-5',
    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is the difference between recognition and recall?',
    answer: 'Recognition is identifying previously learned information when it is presented again (e.g., multiple choice). Recall is retrieving information from memory without cues (e.g., fill-in-the-blank). Recall is generally harder but leads to better retention.',

  {
    id: 'demo-card-6',
    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is cognitive load theory?',
    answer: 'Cognitive load theory suggests that working memory has limited capacity, and learning is more effective when instruction is designed to reduce unnecessary cognitive load, allowing more mental resources for learning.',
    nextReviewDate: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000 * 6).toISOString(), // Due in 6 days

    id: 'demo-card-7',
    deckId: 'demo-deck-1',
    question: 'What is the testing effect?',
    answer: 'The testing effect (also called retrieval practice) refers to the finding that actively retrieving information from memory enhances long-term retention more than simply re-reading or re-studying the material.',
    nextReviewDate: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000 * 8).toISOString(), // Due in 8 days

    question: 'What is metacognitive monitoring?',
    answer: 'Metacognitive monitoring is the process of assessing and tracking one\'s own understanding and performance during learning. This includes judgments of learning (JOL) and confidence ratings, which can help optimize study strategies.',
